/**
 * What the process tells the application: the incoming half of the BPMN wiring.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a driving adapter, the same kind of thing as {@link ApiController}: something
 * outside triggers, and the trigger is translated into a call to {@link Service}. That the
 * caller is a BPMS rather than a browser changes nothing about the direction.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * There is no {@code @Transactional} here, and adding one would be a mistake. VanillaBP
 * loads the aggregate, runs the method and saves the aggregate in one transaction it owns,
 * and it commits that transaction for a {@code TaskException} on purpose. A transaction
 * declared by the application would roll back instead, which is the difference between a
 * rejected loan and a loan that looks untouched. VanillaBP does not let that happen
 * unnoticed: such an annotation on this class or on a {@code @WorkflowTask} method fails the
 * boot naming the method, and one on a bean further down the call chain fails the task while
 * it runs.
 * </p>
