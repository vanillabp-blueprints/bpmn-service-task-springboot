/**
 * The business service of this use case: what the application can do with a loan
 * approval, expressed without a single word about processes.
 *
 * <p>
 * It never touches VanillaBP, with one exception which is the subject of this blueprint:
 * {@link TaskException} tells the process that a business case ended in a way the BPMN
 * models. That is not a technical detail leaking in, it is the vocabulary the business
 * shares with the model.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note where {@code @Transactional} sits. It is on the method the API calls, because
 * starting a workflow has to run in a transaction. It is deliberately absent from
 * {@link #assessCreditRating}: VanillaBP already runs a task handler in a transaction of
 * its own, and a second one declared here would roll back on {@code TaskException} and
 * throw away exactly the state the BPMN error is supposed to leave behind. VanillaBP sees
 * the transaction it can no longer commit and fails the task naming it, so the mistake shows
 * up rather than costing data.
